# Node.js - First Web Server
## :clipboard:Description
My very first experience creating a simple Node.JS Web server. 
Done with the help of [Traversy Media Node.js Crash Course on YouTube](https://youtu.be/fBNz5xF-Kx4?list=PLpqOYy4sbYg8BjPyPmobyMaHiQ3lJH30J)
Project used as a learning tool to learn some basic Web Server back-end foundations with Node.js 

## :wrench: Tools used
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## :gift:Special Thanks
I'm just so grateful that [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) provides his tutorials on Web Development, found on his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) and hist Node.js tutorial actually helped me a lot while building this project!
